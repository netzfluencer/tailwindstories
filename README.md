# tailwindstories
This repository contains vue components build with tailwindcss and documented in storybook. It is designed and developed from a scientific study work @th-koeln. The idea and basic fundaments are from a hobby freetime project which after presentation were developed into an production state within a project of the AVACO GmbH. This library summarizes the results of my project at AVACO GmbH and may give a general boilerplate for other libraries.

The scientific documentation (german) can bee found on: https://github.com/netzfluencer/Science_Vue-Components-Library-Tailwindcss 

If you have any requests you can write me github@marvin.works.
