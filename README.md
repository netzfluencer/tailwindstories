# tailwindstories
This repository contains vue components build with tailwindcss and documented in storybook. It is designed and developed from a scientific study work @th-koeln. The idea and basic fundaments are from a hobby freetime project which after presentation were developed into an production state within a project of the AVACO GmbH. This library summarizes the results of the AVACO GmbH.
