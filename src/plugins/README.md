# Plugins
This directory contains Tailwindcss-Plugins which can get imported into a tailwind.config.js.
These Plugins contain more opinionated, complex css-classes like buttons, form controls, alerts, etc; the sort of pre-built components which you often see in other frameworks. ([Reference Tailwind Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#adding-components)).

Although plugins can customize and extend the available tailwind-utility-classes, which are generally defining the stylings of all project components.

We can also compare the utility classes with the terminology of "Design Tokens" by [Salesforce](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/), but in a css-class-approach:

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.
