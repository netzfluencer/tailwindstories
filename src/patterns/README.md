# Patterns
> Patterns are UI Patterns that fall on the more complex side of the spectrum. So for example things like a date picker, a data table, or a visualization. Patterns utilize both elements and tokens. 
> If you wonder whether something should be called an element or a pattern, ask yourself this question: *“Can this be broken down into smaller pieces?”* If the answer is yes, it should most likely be a pattern.
